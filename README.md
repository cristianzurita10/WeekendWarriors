# \# Weekend Warriors: Sunday League Manager

# 

# > \*\*A zero-dependency sports management simulation built with a custom State Machine architecture in Vanilla JavaScript.\*\*

# 

# \## 📖 Project Overview

# Weekend Warriors is a browser-based strategy game that simulates the management of an amateur football team. The application focuses on resource allocation, risk management, and stochastic event simulation. Unlike standard web games, this project is architected as a Single Page Application (SPA) without external frameworks, demonstrating efficient DOM manipulation and state management.

# 

# \## ⚙️ Technical Architecture

# The core logic is built upon three main pillars:

# 

# \* \*\*State Machine Pattern:\*\* The game flow is controlled by a strict finite state machine, ensuring data integrity across different phases (HQ, Squad Management, Match Simulation).

# \* \*\*Client-Side Persistence:\*\* Utilizes the `localStorage` API to serialize and store complex objects (Team Roster, Financial History, League Table), allowing for session continuity.

# \* \*\*Strict Economy Logic:\*\* Implements backend-style validation on the frontend to prevent unauthorized transactions and enforce bankruptcy conditions.

# 

# \## 🚀 Usage

# This project requires no build tools or package managers.

# 

# 1\.  Clone the repository.

# 2\.  Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
